# Adding Natural Numbers: Zero

Date: Mar 19, 2022 2:38 AM CDT

This is my official first entry, written in the middle of the night, and my mind is too active to sleep. I want to start something. Lots of somethings. I kind of know where I want to go with this. I kind of don't. One thing I do know is that I've got a name for what this will be:

    Adding Natural Numbers

My name is Miguel, and I'm a software developer by trade, and I have a casual interest in math, among other things. I'll probably reveal those in time, but for now, I just want to explain the name.

Natural numbers are most commonly known as the integers from zero onward toward infinity, but that's not really it. Really, those are just the names we give the natural numbers. More fundamentally, natural numbers count, and counting can be described as successively proceeding from some starting point. The count is just how many successions there were from the starting point. Now, I don't really want to get too deep into the math, but I want to focus on the idea of successively starting from somewhere. In particular, I'm starting this blog here, and I see all the future things I have in mind as successively proceeding from here. This post is my number zero. 

Further, I don't plan on just starting this blog. Like I said at the beginning, I want to start lots of things. Things that may not be related, and I will also be continuing things that I've already started. Each natural numbers themselves, and I want these things to add up. Hence, I'm "adding natural numbers".

As for why I bothered mentioning that I'm a software developer, I'm actually writing this in an app called GitJournal, I downloaded this app a while ago originally to jot down code on nights like these while avoiding getting up and out of bed. It supported Markdown and presumably it's using Git in the background. As a software developer, I'm well familiar with both, and I needed to start somewhere with something I already knew. Most likely, after I finally go to sleep and wake up in the morning, I'll probably transcribe this post into a brand new repository on my desktop, which is why I'm making a big deal about what I'm using right now. This is my zero post, and it didn't start over there. It started here.

I also decided to use my actual name here too. Mostly, it's a reminder that I don't intend this blog to be a private one, although I may include certain private details, with prudence of course. I mainly want to cover topics that I'm currently thinking about and want to do something with. I'm starting with an audience of zero, but I don't want to keep it that way. We'll see where it goes and what it all adds up to, but right now, I just need to go to sleep, and I just spent an hour writing all this. So good night, zero audience!
