The double ledger accounting table is modeled after the accounting equation:

`A = L + E`

  where `A` is the total value of your assets,
        `L` is the total value of your liabilities, and
        `E` is the total value of your equities.

Accounts that are described by the left side of the equation are debit accounts.

Accounts that are described by the right side of the equation are credit accounts.

Here's a nifty mnemonic for how to oversee and decrease balances for debit and credit accounts.

`👍 Like for increase | 👎 Unlike for decrease`

Desired Change   | Debit Accounts | Credit Accounts
---              | ---   | ---
Increase Balance | Debit | Credit
Decrease Balance | Credit | Debit

What is debit? 
- It's what you own.
- It's what you spend.
- It's the left side.

What is credit?
- It's what you owe.
- It's what you earn.
- It's the right side.
